## 1. Introduction

In a Fresh Produce Industry, How much stock do you have on hand? Not too little that you run out of stock when customers want to buy more. And not too much that food waste occurs. How do you set your prices? Yields from farms fluctuate by season. Should your prices then also fluctuate by season?

The aim of this project is to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost, given certain parameters.

For the predictions, the train-set data will be used.

The variable to be predicted(y) is Average Price per Kg

### 2.2 Dataset

##### Description of files in datasets:

  * Train - Dataset training our model
  train = pd.read_csv('df_train_set.csv')
  
  * Test - Dataset testing our model (y variables to be predicted)
  test = pd.read_csv('df_test_set.csv')
  
  NB: We used jupyter notebook to run codes to import. The data was read from one file.

### 2.3 EDA
Categorical Variables: 
* Province
* Container
* Size Grade
* Commodities
* Date

Total number of Variables:
13 (including the target variable)

  
#### List of graphs created to explore data included in our notebook:

  - Figure 1. Overall data distribution: distribution of each of the feature in the 'train' dataset
  - Figure 2. Density plot of each feature
  - Figure 3. Bar plot, Size Grade
  - Figure 4. Checking correlations: correlations heat map for the variables in the 'train' dataset.
  - figure 5. distribution of the target variable
  
  ### 2.4 Modelling
  
  #### 2.4.1 Preprocessing
  
  We started by analyzing the data and finding the columns that had any missing values, or had no relevance to the final prediction.
  
  
  #### 2.4.5 Models used
  
  Linear
  Decision Tree Regressor
  Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, AdaBoost Regressors
  Cat Boost Regressors

### 2.5 Model selection

The moment weâ€™ve all been waiting for!

We trained above different regression models and discovered that VotingRegressor returned the highest score, with a Train RMSE of 0.097 Test RMSE of 0.094.
